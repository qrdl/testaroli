/*
Package testaroli allows to monkey patch Go test binary, e.g. override functions
and methods with stubs/mocks to simplify unit testing.
It should be used only for unit testing and never in production!

# Platforms suported

This package modifies actual executable at runtime, therefore is OS- and CPU arch-specific.

Supported OS/arch combinations:
  - Linux / x86_64
  - Linux / ARM64
  - Windows / x86_64
  - macOS / x86_64
  - macOS / ARM64

# The concept

This package allows you to modify test binary to call your mocks instead of functions it supposed to call.
It internally maintains the override chain, it means it is possible not to override all needed functions
with mocks at the start, but one by one, thus controlling the order of calls. To achieve this, when overriding
function with mock it is required to specify the number of calls this mock should be called, and when this
counter is reached, the overridden function gets reset to its original state i.e. no longer overridden, and
next function in the chain gets overridden.

However, there are to special counter values - [Unlimited] and [Always]. Override with [Unlimited] count is
not removed from chain until [Reset]/[ResetAll] function is called, it means no overrides behind [Unlimited]
one become effective until [Unlimited] override is reset.

[Always] override, unlike any other overrides, is always effective, it means if doesn't belong to the chain.
If it is not important to control correct order of mock calls, the test case can use only [Always] overrides.
However, there is a limitation - [Always] override for the function X is mutually exclusive with any other
override for the same function X, so attempt to [Always] override previously overridden function will panic.
Similarly to all other overrides, [Always] override can be reset with [Reset]/[ResetAll].

# Command line options

It is recommended to switch off compiler optimisations and disable function inlining
using `-gcflags="all=-N -l"` CLI option when running tests, like this:

	go test -gcflags="all=-N -l" [<path>]

Typical use:

	// you want to test function foo() which in turn calls function bar(), so you
	// override function bar() to check whether it is called with correct argument
	// and to return predefined result

	func foo() error {
	    ...
	    if err := bar(baz); err != nil {
	        return err
	    }
	    ...
	}

	func bar(baz int) error {
	    ...
	}

	func TestBarFailing(t *testing.T) {
	    Override(TestingContext(t), bar, Once, func(a int) error {
	        Expectation().CheckArgs(a)  // <-- actual arg 'a' value compared with expected value 42
	        return ErrInvalid
	    })(42) // <-- expected argument value

	    err := foo()
	    if !errors.Is(err, ErrInvalid) {
	        t.Errorf("unexpected %v", err)
	    }
	    if err = ExpectationsWereMet(); err != nil {
	        t.Error(err)
	    }
	}

It is also possible to override functions and methods in other packages, including ones
from standard library, like in example below. Please note that method receiver becomes the
first argument of the mock function.

	func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
	    Override(TestingContext(t), (*os.File).Read, Once, func(f *os.File, b []byte) (n int, err error) {
	        Expectation()
	        copy(b, []byte("foo"))
	        return 3, nil
	    })

	    f, _ := os.Open("test.file")
	    defer f.Close()
	    buf := make([]byte, 3)
	    n, _ := f.Read(buf)
	    if n != 3 || string(buf) != "foo" {
	        t.Errorf("unexpected file content %s", string(buf))
	    }
	    if err = ExpectationsWereMet(); err != nil {
	        t.Error(err)
	    }
	}

/*
Override overrides <org> with <mock>. The signatures of <org> and <mock> must match exactly,
otherwise compilation error is reported.
It has <count> argument to specify how many calls to <org> functions are expected, which must be
a positive number, [Unlimited] or [Always]. If this is the first non-[Always] override, the function
get overridden immediately, all subsequent non-[Always] overrides are put into override chain.
After <org> function got called <count> times, the <org> function is no longer overridden and next
override in the chain becomes effective.

[Unlimited] value for <count> means that there is no limit for number of <org> calls. Override
following [Unlimited] one in he chain becomes effective only after [Unlimited] override is reset
with [Reset]/[ResetAll].

[Always] value for count means that override is not a part of override chain and and always effective
(until reset). It is an error to [Always] override previously overridden function or override the
function that was previously overriden with [Always], in either case Override panics.

It is ok to call Override several times, however only the first override becomes immediately effecive,
all subsequent overrides are placed in the chain and become effective only when previous override is
completed. It means that order of overrides must match the order of called functions exactly. For example:

	// Function bar() will be overridden only after override for foo() is processed
	Override(ctx, foo, Once, func (a int, b string) {
	    Expectation().CheckArgs(a, b)
	})(42, "qwerty")
	Override(ctx, bar, Once, func (a int) {
	    Expectation().CheckArgs(a)
	})(1024)

	// foo() is overridden, bar() is not
	bar(512)          // <--- call to original bar()
	foo(42, "qwerty") // <--- call to overridden version of foo()
	// bar() is overridden, foo() is not
	bar(1024)         // <--- call to overridden version of bar()
	// nothing is overridden

Override returns function of generic type T that allows to set expected values for function call, like this:

	Override(ctx, foo, Once, func (a int, b string) {
	    Expectation().CheckArgs(a, b)
	})(42, "bar")

and it works the same as

	Override(ctx, foo, Once, func (a int, b string) {
	    Expectation().Expect(42, "bar").CheckArgs(a, b)
	})

but has a benefit of checking types for expected values at compile time, thanks to Go generics.

Override takes a context as a first argument, and this context must be created with
[TestingContext] or derived from the context, returned by [TestingContext]. This function panics
if is given invalid context.

It is important to remember that mock function is executed in the scope of original function, therefore
variables and functions, declared within test case scope, are not accessible, although compiler considers
the code valid. To overcome this limitation pass the variable in the context, in this case you can obtain
the variable from the context from within mock function, for example:

	ctx := context.WithValue(TestingContext(t), key, 100)
	Override(ctx, bar, Once, func() {
	    // using 'val' here leads to runtime errors
	    val := Expectation().Context().Value(key).(int)
	    // now 'val' is ok to use and contains the value 100
	})

You can override regular functions and methods, including standard ones, but not the interface methods.
