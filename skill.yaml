  capabilities:
    - "Override package functions"
    - "Override methods (instance and pointer receivers)"
    - "Override standard library functions"
    - "Chain multiple overrides in sequence"
    - "Validate function call arguments"

  requirements:
    compiler_flags:
      - "-gcflags=all=-N -l"
    reason: "Disables optimizations and inlining for runtime patching"

      arch: ["amd64", "arm64"]
    
    go_version: "1.24.0+"
  
  limitations:
    - "Generic functions have limited support (call via reference only)"
    - "Cannot override inlined functions"
    - "Platform-dependent (OS and architecture specific)"
    - "Testing only - never use in production"
    - "Requires specific compiler flags"
